This simple program, which I wrote mainly as an excuse to try out the Hare
programming language [1], reads a list of letter pairs from a file, then
prompts the user for commands. The interface is similar to that of ed(1).
The main command 'r' starts a random training session, which consists of 
the program printing a random letter pair, waiting for the use to type
enter, print the text associated with the letter pair, waiting again and
repeating until EOF (Ctrl+D) is encountered.

To try it out run:

hare run lepa.ha example.txt

Then type 'r' followed by Enter to start the random training session.
Other commands include '?' (help) and 'q' (quit).
